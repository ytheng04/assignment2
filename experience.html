          <h3>2024</h3>
          <p>My first interview. I prepared a lot of questions that might be asked, but the interview was easier than I thought, just like chatting. 
            The experience of the first interview made me braver to face more interviews in the future.</p>

          <h3>2023</h3>
          <p>Participated in the art camp, which was a camp organized by my sister. I participated in it during the form6 holidays. 
            I met many juniors and discovered many different new things. In particular, I learned to listen to other people's ideas and respect them.</p>

          <h3>2022</h3>
          <p>After graduating from SPM, I worked for the first time. I woke up at 7 o'clock every day to work and got home at 8 o'clock in the evening. 
            Although I met bad people, it was a very important social experience. It taught me to protect myself and be wary of others.</p>

          <h3>2021</h3>
          <p>My first time to organize a camp. I learned from the camps I had participated in before and started to consider various details and factors. 
            I successfully organized a camp and let my juniors become our campers. 
            It was a very important experience because my efforts were seen and I learned a lot.</p>

          <h3>2020</h3>
          <p>Affected by covid-19, I participated in the online camp for the first time.
            I listened to several lectures and played games online. 
            Although it was difficult to play, I still met new friends and ended the online camp happily.</p>

          <h3>2019</h3>
          <p>I was the team leader for the first time. I led my own team in the camp, took care of the younger team members, played and trained with them. 
            It was a happy memory.</p>

          <h3>2018</h3>
          <p>Participated in the sports meeting drill competition for the first time. 
            I was a member of the police cadets. On that day, I wore the first uniform of the police cadets for the first time, which was a complete uniform.</p>

          <h3>2017</h3>
          <p>Participated in the first camp, which was the National Chinese Language Society Camp for Secondary Schools. 
            It was the first time I stayed overnight outside and could not sleep, but I met a lot of good people. It was a precious memory and experience.</p>

          <h3>2016</h3>
          <p>Participated in a crosstalk performance. It was the first time I performed crosstalk in front of the whole class. 
            I was very nervous, but the teacher praised me after the performance. 
            I, who was always stage-frightened, successfully took the first step.</p>
