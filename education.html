      <h3>SMJK Krian</h3>
      <p>I spent my time in SMJK Krian from Form 1 to Form 5. 
        It is a school with a good school spirit and is an important memory for me. 
      <br>The school motto of SMJK Krian is "Propriety, Righteousness, Honesty and Shame".
      <br>From this, I learned that propriety is the most important quality of a person and 
        I respects the characteristics of everyone.

      <h3>SMK Tunku Abdul Rahman(Form 6)</h3>
      <p>Since my secondary school did not have Form 6 courses, I came to SMK Tunku Abdul Rahman to continue my studies. 
       <br>I benefited a lot from the Form 6 courses, and the most important thing I gained was my best friends 
        and the teachers who were so kind to me.
       <br>This journey is very meaningful to me and has laid the foundation for my future.</p>

      <h3>Universiti Malaysia Perlis (UniMAP)</h3>
      <p>So far, I have come to University Malaysia Perlis, UniMAP.
        I am very grateful for the opportunity to come here, and I am also grateful for everything here, teachers, friends, everything. 
        University life is beyond my expectations, but full of challenges. 
        I have been exposed to many different things, learned things that I am not familiar with, and had more opportunities to exercise myself.
        These have gradually made me brave, dare to try, dare to fight, dare to refuse, and dare to dream.
      <br>And this reminds me of a saying: the future is long, and so are dreams.
